# 🕯️ Haunted Escape Room (React)

A silly little horror escape room game built with React — full of creaky doors, creepy riddles, and a time limit that’ll trap you forever... or at least until you refresh. 😈

## 🧠 What It Is

You’re trapped in a haunted house and must solve a series of eerie puzzles before time runs out. If you guess wrong, the ghosts get louder. If you guess right, the door creaks open and you move on. Finish all rooms to escape... or join the spirits. 👻
